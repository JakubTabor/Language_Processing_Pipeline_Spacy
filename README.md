# Language_Processing_Pipeline_Spacy
Here I gonna use some cool technics to preprocess text in English and Spanish
# First I "import spacy" and create nlp object with English as language and with blanc pipeline, so without any tools
# Then i load to my nlp object "trained small model(with few thousand en. words)" 
# Now I check the tools of my model and see that my pipeline is full of useful tools
# I gonna put a text into my nlp object and start for loop for every token in my object, it will print first the token, then description and then base word
# Token is each word, then "pos" describe part of speech np. Verb, Num, Noun, Pron. "lemma" take word and change into base word np. eats into eat.

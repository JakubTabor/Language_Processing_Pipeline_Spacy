# Language_Processing_Pipeline_Spacy
Here I gonna use some cool technics to preprocess text in English and Spanish
# First I "import spacy" and create nlp object with English as language and with blanc pipeline, so without any tools
# Then i load to my nlp object "trained small model(with few thousand en. words)"
